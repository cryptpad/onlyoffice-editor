/**
 * Check A — source-side replacement audit.
 *
 * Verifies that every load-bearing string-replace-loader pattern still matches
 * the expected number of occurrences in apps/**\/\*.js.  Run BEFORE webpack so
 * the pipeline fails fast if an upstream sync or refactor has changed an idiom
 * that a replacement shim depended on.
 *
 * Exit 0 with a summary line per entry on success.
 * Exit 1 with specific failure messages on any count mismatch.
 *
 * Re-baseline procedure (when a count legitimately changes):
 *   1. Run this script — it prints the actual count.
 *   2. Update minCount / exact in build/replacements.manifest.mjs.
 *   3. Commit the baseline change IN THE SAME COMMIT as the source change.
 *   A drop must NEVER be re-baselined without confirming removed occurrences
 *   were intentionally eliminated (not silently refactored past the shim).
