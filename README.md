# onlyoffice-client

This is a wrapper around the OnlyOffice Client ([sdkjs](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/sdkjs)/[web-apps](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/web-apps)). It provides the same interface as the [DocEditor](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/methods) class. However, this wrapper allows to use the OnlyOffice Client without using the DocumentServer.

When using this library without a DocumentServer, some of the servers functionality has to be provided on the client/browser side.
